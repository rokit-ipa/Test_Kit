## Environmental conditions for performing the tests

Static (Environment is similar throughout the test apparatus, minor fluctuations in temp. throughout the apparatus)

#### Lighting

- Ambient lighting:
    - Exposed bulbs (fluorescent, can lights),
    - Spotlight (direct away from the A-UGV),
    - Sunlight (the A-UGV is tested in bright sunlight),
    - Reflected (bulb directed at the ceiling),
    - Filtered (diffused light through translucent glass).
- Lighting from sources (directed):
    - Exposed bulb, Spotlight, Sunlight, Reflected, Filtered, Laser, Light from another vehicle.

#### External Emission

- External emitters can be multiple time-of-flight cameras, fork-lift pedestrian lights, 3D structured light sensors, and light detection and ranging sensors (LIDAR).
- These can affect robot performance.
- During testing report should include the following details:
- External Emitter Configuration, Type of emitter(s), Quantity of emitter(s), External Emitter Source Location, Spectrum—Identify primary colour and peak wavelength.

#### Temperature: (10 °C to 30 °C)

- Temperature variations can affect onboard electronics, create condensation, cause hydraulic fluid viscosity, and reduce battery life and recharge rate.
    - **Level 1:** below 0°C to 0°C (for example, freezer).
    - **Level 2:** 0°C to 15°C (perishable storage).
    - **Level 3:** 16°C to 26°C (office, warehouse).
    - **Level 4:** 27°C to 49°C (warehouse).
    - **Level 5:** Above 49°C (foundries, forges).

#### Humidity: (0 % to 80 %)

- High humidity combined with dew point temperature causes condensation, can short electronics and affect lenses and other A-UGV components, cause corrosion.
- Low Humidity will dramatically increase static electricity and the need for adequate discharge.
- Relative Humidity Level:
   -  Low – less than 30 %.
   -  Moderately Low – 31 to 55 %.
    - Moderately High – 56 to 75%.
    -  High – greater than 75 %.

#### Electrical Interference:

Static charge builds up on the vehicle and voltage drop from the battery's positive lead and the chassis changes. Strong magnetic fields can impact the onboard electrical components, and data storage within the onboard computer. Radio frequency (RF) interference can degrade wireless network connections networks and A-UGV capability.

#### Air Flow and Quality:

- Clear – (clean room, no visible air particulates).
- Moderate – (visible fog, dust, light to moderate rain/snow/fog).
- Dense – (dust storm, heavy snow/rain/fog).

#### Floor or Ground Surface:

- Coefficient of Friction: (0.75 - 1)
- High (brushed concrete, asphalt).
- Moderate (polished/sealed concrete, steel plates, packed dirt).
- Low (icy, wet, lubricated, dry sand).
